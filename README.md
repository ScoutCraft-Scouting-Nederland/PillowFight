# PillowFight
Levend Stratego is a gamemode where two teams have to search for a flag. They can hinder eachother by tagging, where a rank will decided who will win the fight.

## The gameplay
Players go into a lobby and can vote for the arena, gamemode (teams, duo, solo) and power-ups or no powerups. After the countdown ends the players will be teleported to a arena where they get a wool block. The players now can tag eachother and they will fly away. If a player falls of a platform, they will loose a life.

The power-ups are:
- Dash
- Dubble jump
- Extra life
- Invincible
- Pillow explotion
- Super pillow

If players play teammode, the teams will have an equal amount of lives.

## Maps
We have lots of maps available for Pillowfight. You can download them [here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/scoutcraft/).

### Slime World Manager
The plugins only supports the slime world manager format for loading worlds. This is a very fast method of loading minigame worlds. To learn more about SWM, see: [Github SWM](https://github.com/Paul19988/Advanced-Slime-World-Manager)

## Integration with Eagle
PillowFight is at the moment, tightly integrated with ScoutCraft's Eagle plugins. Eagle is a set of plugins for the server, proxy and a library. You have to install the full package to get it working. With some work it should be possible to make it (mostly) stand-alone. Eagle supports, among other things:
- Parties
- Database management
- Status updates for NPS's in the lobby

## Developing
### Contributing
As the ScoutCraft project has officially ended, we don't update our resources anymore on regular basis. That said, we do monitor the repositories and are open for PR's and issues.

### TODO
If you want to add or change something, we suggest the following things to change:
- Make a fork where Eagle is optional for the gamemode (or a plugin which is 1 .jar)
- Make version which works with normal worlds.
- Make a very good tutorial on how to set up.

### Reporting Bugs
We do not update our plugins on a regular basis. That said, ff an issue is critical, we will look into a solution. You are welcome to make a bug report.

### Contributing code
You are welcome to change this plugin to your liking. Fixes for bugs will be added to our plugin. If you want to do more development and change the plugin (such as adding features), you need to make a fork. As we use this as an archive. We will mention forks with great improvements, such as new features, new maps, etcetera. If you think your fork should be mentioned, send us an email!
